# Accident-Detect-Alert-And-Prevention-System
## ðŸš— Accident Prevention, Detection, and Alert System

This project is a compact, cost-effective, and Arduino-based safety system designed to reduce road accident fatalities by detecting critical situations and ensuring rapid emergency response.

### ðŸ›  Features

* **Accident Detection**: Uses an ADXL335 accelerometer to detect sudden impacts or vehicle tilts.
* **Location Tracking**: Integrates a NEO-6M GPS module to pinpoint the accident location.
* **Emergency Alerts**: Sends automated SMS alerts via the SIM800L GSM module to predefined emergency contacts.
* **Alcohol Detection**: Monitors the driver's alcohol level using an MQ-3 alcohol sensor.
* **Drowsiness Detection**: Uses an eye-blink sensor to detect driver fatigue or sleepiness.
* **Safety Response**: Activates a buzzer and stops the motor in case of alcohol or drowsiness detection.

### ðŸ’¡ Objective

To enhance road safety and minimize response time in case of accidents by leveraging affordable and easily deployable electronic components.
